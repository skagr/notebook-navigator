1.Definitions

1.1 “Software” means the Notebook Navigator plugin, including its source code, documentation, and associated files made available by the Licensor.
1.2 “Licensor” means Johan Sanneblad.
1.3 “Official Repository” means the repository designated by the Licensor as official, currently https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator (and any successor designated by prominent notice in the README and/or an Official Release).
1.4 “Official Release” means a versioned, public release published from the Official Repository (for example a Git tag and/or GitHub Release corresponding to a plugin version).
1.5 “Actively Maintained” means at least one Official Release has been published within the last twelve (12) months.
1.6 “Fork” means any repository or distribution that copies, modifies, or is derived from the Software.
1.7 “Obsidian Directory” means the official Obsidian Community Plugins directory (and any official successor listing).
1.7a “Submit for inclusion” means to propose a plugin for addition to the Obsidian Directory under the Directory’s normal submission process (for example by opening a submission or pull request).
1.8 “Plugin ID” means the id value in manifest.json (and the corresponding folder name used by Obsidian).
1.9 “Installable Files” means the files needed to install the plugin (typically manifest.json and main.js, and optionally styles.css), whether separate or packaged.
1.10 “Free of charge" means no payment is required to obtain, access, install, or use the Software or a Fork, including through bundling or any indirect fee that is a condition of access. Charging for unrelated products or services is allowed if access to the Software or Fork remains Free of charge.

2.Acceptance

By using, copying, modifying, or sharing the Software, you agree to this License.

3.License grant

Subject to this License, you may use, copy, and modify the Software for any purpose, including internal commercial use within your organization. This license is non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free.

4.Forks and free sharing (allowed)

You may create Forks and share the Software or modified versions Free of charge (including publicly on GitHub), including sharing Installable Files, provided you follow all rules below.

4.1 Include an unmodified copy of this License in your Fork (for example as LICENSE).
4.2 Do not remove or alter copyright, attribution, or license notices.

4.3 Unofficial labeling (required)
Your Fork must be clearly marked as unofficial and not endorsed by the Licensor. Minimum requirements:
a) The repository name OR the top of the README includes “Unofficial”, “Fork”, or “Community Continuation”, and
b) The README states near the top: “Unofficial fork. Not endorsed by Johan Sanneblad.” (or equivalent), and
c) If your Fork is intended for others to install, the plugin display name (name in manifest.json) must include “Unofficial” or an equivalent qualifier.

4.4 Trademarks and branding
a) You may use the words “Notebook Navigator” only to truthfully state that your Fork is based on the Software (for example “Unofficial fork of Notebook Navigator”).
b) You must not use the Licensor’s logo or other trademarks as your Fork’s branding, and you must not imply endorsement or that your Fork is official.

4.5 Plugin ID (avoid collisions and confusion)
Any Fork that is shared publicly must use a different Plugin ID than the official Software. Keeping the original Plugin ID is permitted only for private, non-shared forks or for an officially transferred Obsidian Directory listing.

4.6 License with downloads
If you share Installable Files as a download (zip, release assets, direct files), you must include this License with the download or provide a clear link next to the download to where this License can be read.

5.No Obsidian Directory submission while Actively Maintained

5.1 While the Software is Actively Maintained, you must not submit any Fork or derivative of the Software for inclusion as a listing in the Obsidian Directory.
5.2 This does not prevent an official transfer of the existing Obsidian Directory listing through the Directory’s normal process.
5.3 This License does not override Obsidian’s own directory rules and does not guarantee acceptance of any submission.

6.Abandoned plugin policy (12-month lapse)

6.1 If no Official Release has been published for twelve (12) consecutive months, then a Fork may be listed in the Obsidian Directory only if all conditions below are met:
a) It is Free of charge.
b) It is clearly labeled as unofficial and not endorsed (Section 4.3).
c) It does not use the Licensor’s trademarks as branding and does not imply endorsement (Section 4.4).
d) It includes an unmodified copy of this License.
e) It prominently credits Johan Sanneblad as the original author in the README and in the Obsidian Directory listing description.
f) Its Obsidian Directory listing title clearly indicates it is unofficial (for example includes “Unofficial” or “Community Continuation”) and is not exactly “Notebook Navigator”.

6.2 Plugin ID for Obsidian Directory listings after a lapse
a) A continuation fork should use a new Plugin ID.
b) Reusing the original Plugin ID is allowed only if the Obsidian Directory listing has been officially transferred or updated through the Directory’s normal process.

6.3 If the Licensor resumes active maintenance
If the Licensor publishes an Official Release after a continuation fork has been listed under Section 6, the continuation fork may remain listed. Within a reasonable time (recommended: 30 days), it must:
a) Update its README and Obsidian Directory listing description to prominently state the official plugin is active again and link to the Official Repository.
b) Continue to comply with Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
c) Not claim to be the official plugin or official successor unless the Obsidian Directory listing is officially transferred or updated to point to the Official Repository.

7.Commercial restrictions

7.1 You must not charge any fee for access to, installation of, or use of the Software (or any Fork), and you must not place it behind a paywall, without the Licensor’s prior written permission.
7.2 You may charge for unrelated products or services (for example consulting, support, training, or hosting), provided access to the Software (or any Fork) remains Free of charge.
7.3 Voluntary donations are allowed if they do not gate access, features, or updates.

8.Contributions

If you submit contributions to the Official Repository, you grant the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense those contributions.

9.Third-party components
